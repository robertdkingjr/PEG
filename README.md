# PEG rulebook

## Overview

PEG (Play, Eat, Grow) is a fast-paced, spatial strategy game where players compete to grow their population of pegs on a shared hexagonal landscape. Food is placed onto the board by fate and players compete to consume it to fuel their growth. Victory is achieved not by a scoreboard but by controlling space: the first player to place all their pegs onto the board wins.

*   PEG board
*   Rain Dice (one blue D6 per player)
*   Food Dice (six D6s in each player color)
*   Pegs in player colors

## Setup

*   Configure board hexes for number of players and game style
*   Place starting pegs
*   Roll to determine starting PEG order

## Game Phases

### P: PLAY Phase

(ALL)
*   Roll Rain Die: result = number of Food Dice to roll
*   Roll Food Dice
*   Place all rolled dice onto board hex matching color and face
    *   Players can choose between multiple options in some cases
*   Push all unused dice against board to show they are not in player hands

### E: EAT Phase

(IN PEG ORDER)
*   Pull dice off of a hex adjacent to player peg and place in hand
    *   Dice can be any color (not limited to eating own color)
    *   Max dice per turn limited to number of pegs touching hex
*   Continue until all possible dice have been pulled by all players

(ALL)
*   Update PEG order based on dice in hand
    *   Least dice in hand = first in PEG order
    *   Most dice in hand = last in PEG order
    *   Same # dice = maintain relative order

### G: GROW Phase

(ALL)
*   Option to reroll any dice in hand once.

(IN ORDER)
*   Choose one option:
    *   Spend matching dice to place new pegs on the board (see table below)
        *   Pegs must be placed adjacent to existing pegs
    *   Spend dice to move pegs already on the board
        *   Sum of die faces = movement range
        *   Range can be shared across multiple pegs

| **Dice (6s = Wild)** | **Pegs** |
| ---| --- |
| Single 6 | +1 |
| Any Pair | +1 |
| Pair of 6s | +2 |
| Any Triple | +2 |
| Triple 6s | +3 |
| Any Quad (4-of-a-kind) | +3 |
| Quad 6s | +4 |
| Any Quint (5-of-a-kind) | +4 |
| Quint 6s | +5 |
| Any Sext (6-of-a-kind) | +5 |
| Sext 6s | +6 |

## Winning the Game

The first player to place all their pegs on the board wins!

## Optional Tweaks and Variants

### Sized pegs
*   Pegs start at size = 1
*   Growth can either add a new peg of the same size or double the size of a peg
*   \[EAT\] Size determines the number of dice that can be pulled from a hex per turn
*   \[GROW\] Size determines peg range and movement limitations. Pegs can only hop over other pegs of equal size or smaller.
